# Hindi-To-English-NMT-Model

Hindi to English Neural Machine Translation(NMT) model is built using Pytorch. In the first phase, a simple Sequence to Sequence model is used. In the second phase, a Sequence to Sequence model with attention mechanism is used. For the final phase, the Sequence to Sequence model with attention mechanism with the best hyperparameters obtained is used.
